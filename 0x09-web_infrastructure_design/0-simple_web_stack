ISSUES WITH THE INFASTRUCTURE
SPOF
The SPOF of this infastructure is in having only a single server computer.

Downtime when maintenance needed
In times of maintanance the entire webpage www.foobar.com will be totally

When traffic increases this infastructure is unscalable with the available
hardware remaining the same.
